Message Warning

    Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
    - path_provider_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
    Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
    Add the following to C:\Work\Flutter-Spotify\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

        android {
            ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
            ...
        }

Fix step
    1. Open Android Studio > SDK Manager
    2. Search for "Android SDK"
    3. Go to the SDK Tools tab
    4. Enable "Show Package Details" in the bottom-right corner
    5. Under NDK (Side by side), select the latest version
    6. Uncheck any older versions to uninstall them automatically, or remove them manually from: 
        C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\
    7. Click Apply to install the latest NDK version
    8. Open the file FlutterExtension.kt located at:
        C:\{installed_flutter_path}\packages\flutter_tools\gradle\src\main\kotlin
    9. Update the line where ndkVersion is declared:
        val ndkVersion: String = "x.y.z"  // Replace with the latest installed version
